## 🧾 Overview

This project is a professional Tableau dashboard designed to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 in Indonesia across time and regions.

As a Data Analyst, I aimed to present key insights in an intuitive and interactive format, using publicly available data.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📅 **Trend Over Time:**  
  Interactive line charts showing the rise in total cases, new cases, and recoveries over time.

- 🗺️ **Geographic Spread:**  
  A dynamic map visualizing total cases by province/region using color intensity.

- 📈 **Summary Metrics:**  
  Total population, deaths, new cases, and recovery rates are summarized for quick analysis.

- 📍 **Region Filter:**  
  Select specific provinces or areas to analyze their performance and situation in more detail.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/)
- Microsoft Excel (for data preprocessing)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio)

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** COVID-19 Indonesia time series dataset (cleaned and transformed using Excel)
- **Data columns used:**
  - `Date`
  - `Location`
  - `Total Cases`
  - `New Cases`
  - `Total Deaths`
  - `Total Recovered`
  - `Population`
  - `Latitude` and `Longitude` (for geospatial mapping)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

Before importing into Tableau:
- Unused columns (e.g., ISO codes, redundant location fields) were removed.
- Dates were standardized.
- Verified `Location`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` mappings for map visualization.
- Ensured numeric formats for all measures (Population, Cases, Deaths).

## 📌 Insights Discovered

- 🚨 Spikes in total cases are seen in July 2021 and February 2022 — aligned with Delta and Omicron waves.
- 📍 DKI Jakarta has the highest total number of cases and deaths.
- 📉 Some regions show low case numbers but high death rates, indicating potential under-reporting or healthcare strain.
- 📊 National trend is flattening toward late 2022, indicating improved control measures.
